# Game List

This project, which will probably become an API, will be an application focused on the backend, which will save game titles from a collection, inside a database. It will also have a frontend to make everything more interactive and exciting.
I will also implement a docker to make the app responsive and professional.

## Learnings

This project gave me a better understanding of how a java api works, how to optimize SQL queries with the objectivity that the spring framework allows us. It was a big challenge to start something of this magnitude, as I study alone and have to consult many articles on the web to correct any mistakes, but that's part of learning.
Hope to finish soon.


## Updates

This project is under development, whenever possible I will be working to continue the implementations and finalize it.
